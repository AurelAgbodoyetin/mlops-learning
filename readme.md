# MLOps Learning Journey üöÄ

My hands-on learning experience mastering MLOps with MLflow.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains all code, experiments, and projects from my intensive MLOps learning journey. Each day's work is organized into dedicated folders with practical implementations, notes, and key learnings.

## üåü Why this mattered to me

Before starting this journey into MLOps, most of my ML projects looked ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù only on paper, but in practice, they had serious cracks. Here are a few pain points I kept hitting:

* **Lost experiments:** I‚Äôd tweak hyperparameters, rerun a model, and then forget which version actually worked best.  My results lived in scattered notebooks, terminal logs, and sometimes in random text files I wrote to keep track. After a few batches of experiments, those logs became a messy jungle I didn‚Äôt want to revisit.
* **Fragile code:** My projects often only worked on *my machine*. Sharing them meant a maze of missing dependencies and broken environments.
* **No clear lifecycle:** I would jump straight from dataset ‚Üí model training ‚Üí accuracy score, skipping the discipline of versioning, tracking, or deployment planning.
* **One-off mentality:** Models were trained once, ‚Äúgood enough,‚Äù and then abandoned‚Äîno monitoring, no retraining strategy.
* **Reproducibility gap:** Coming back to an old project, I sometimes couldn‚Äôt reproduce my own results, even with the same data.

This repo is my attempt at breaking that cycle‚Äîbuilding not just models, but repeatable, shareable, and production-aware workflows.
