# MLOps Learning Journey 🚀

My hands-on learning experience mastering MLOps with MLflow.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains all code, experiments, and projects from my intensive MLOps learning journey. Each day's work is organized into dedicated folders with practical implementations, notes, and key learnings.

## 🌟 Why this mattered to me

Before starting this journey into MLOps, most of my ML projects looked “complete” only on paper, but in practice, they had serious cracks. Here are a few pain points I kept hitting:

* **Lost experiments:** I’d tweak hyperparameters, rerun a model, and then forget which version actually worked best.  My results lived in scattered notebooks, terminal logs, and sometimes in random text files I wrote to keep track. After a few batches of experiments, those logs became a messy jungle I didn’t want to revisit.
* **Fragile code:** My projects often only worked on *my machine*. Sharing them meant a maze of missing dependencies and broken environments.
* **No clear lifecycle:** I would jump straight from dataset → model training → accuracy score, skipping the discipline of versioning, tracking, or deployment planning.
* **One-off mentality:** Models were trained once, “good enough,” and then abandoned—no monitoring, no retraining strategy.
* **Reproducibility gap:** Coming back to an old project, I sometimes couldn’t reproduce my own results, even with the same data.

This repo is my attempt at breaking that cycle—building not just models, but repeatable, shareable, and production-aware workflows.
