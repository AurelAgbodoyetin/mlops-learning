# Day 1

## Topic: MLOps Fundamentals

### ML Project Lifecycle
1. **Business understanding & requirements gathering**  
2. **Data acquisition**  
3. **Data preparation**  
4. **Modeling** (data science team)  
5. **Deployment** (operations team)  
6. **Monitoring & maintenance**  

### What is MLOps?
- **MLOps = Machine Learning + Operations**  
- A set of **principles and practices** that standardize and streamline the **ML lifecycle management**.  
- Extends **DevOps principles** (CI/CD) with **Continuous Training (CT)**, which is unique to ML systems.


### Why MLOps is Needed
- Traditional ML workflows often break down when moving from **research (modeling)** to **production (deployment & monitoring)**.
- Without MLOps:
  - Communication between **data science** and **operations teams** becomes messy.
  - Reproducibility, scalability, and monitoring are often lacking.
  - Manual processes slow down deployment and retraining.
- MLOps addresses these challenges by providing a structured approach to manage the entire ML lifecycle.


### Activities to Productionize a Model
- **Build & test locally**  
- **Package**: Compile code, resolve dependencies  
- **Performance**: Ensure prediction speed, GPU optimization, scalability  
- **Instrument**: Version code, data, features, environment ‚Üí ensure reproducibility  
- **Automate**: Enable Continuous Training (reduce manual work)  


### Key MLOps Principles
- üìë **Documentation**: Notebooks showcase core functionalities  
- üóÇ **Version control**: Code, data, environments, artifacts  
- üê≥ **Containerization & distributed computing**  
- üîÑ **Workflow orchestration**: Build pipelines around MLOps processes  
- üìä **Monitoring**: Track data drift, feature changes, latency, uptime  
  - Tools: **Grafana, Prometheus**  
- ‚ö° **Automation**: Training triggered by events or scheduled retraining

## Key Takeaways
- MLOps ensures **scalable, reproducible, and automated ML workflows**.  
- It bridges the gap between **data science research** and **production deployment**.  
- Core principles: **Versioning, containerization, monitoring, and automation**.
